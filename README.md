# Project: Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 9601 Website

## Overview

I undertook a freelance web development project for a client seeking to revamp their online presence by merging two existing websites into a unified platform. The goal was to create a modern and user-friendly website that seamlessly integrated content for both their post and local memorial sites.




## Objectives

1. **Unified Online Presence:** The client aimed to consolidate their online presence by merging two separate websites, one dedicated to their post and the other to the local memorial site.

2. **User-Friendly Design:** The primary objective was to deliver a user-friendly website with an intuitive interface, ensuring a positive experience for visitors exploring both the post and memorial content.

3. **Content Management:** The client required the ability to independently manage and update site content. To achieve this, I implemented a headless CMS using Strapi, empowering them to make real-time updates without technical assistance.

4. **Technological Stack:**
   - **Frontend:** Developed using React for dynamic and responsive user interfaces, complemented by the styling power of Tailwind CSS.
   - **Backend:** Implemented Strapi as a headless CMS, providing a robust content management solution for the client's needs.



## Contributions

- **Web Development:** Spearheaded the end-to-end development of the website, ensuring a seamless merging of content from both the post and memorial sites.
- **Frontend Technologies:** Leveraged React and Tailwind CSS to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.
- **Content Management:** Implemented a headless CMS with Strapi, empowering the client to take control of content updates without relying on external support.

## Strapi Headless CMS Implementation

In recognizing the user demographic of the client, primarily comprised of older individuals, I strategically opted for Strapi as the headless CMS solution. Strapi's intuitive and easy-to-understand user interface provided the ideal platform for empowering the client to manage and update the website content effortlessly.

The decision to choose Strapi was rooted in its user-friendly design, catering to a diverse audience with varying technical proficiencies. By prioritizing simplicity and clarity in the CMS, I ensured that the client, despite potentially limited technical expertise, could confidently make real-time updates to the website without encountering unnecessary complexities.

This approach not only addressed the specific needs of the client demographic but also contributed to the overall success of the project by fostering independence in content management for the end-users.

## Outcome

Despite the decision to opt for a different developer due to budget considerations, the project stands as a testament to my skills in web development, user interface design, and strategic content management solutions.

The project repository, hosted on GitHub, includes wireframes, code documentation, and a detailed README to showcase the project's potential and the client's vision for a unified online presence.
