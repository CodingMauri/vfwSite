# Project: Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 9601 Website

## Overview

I undertook a freelance web development project for a client seeking to revamp their online presence by merging two existing websites into a unified platform. The goal was to create a modern and user-friendly website that seamlessly integrated content for both their post and local memorial sites.

## Objectives

1. **Unified Online Presence:** The client aimed to consolidate their online presence by merging two separate websites, one dedicated to their post and the other to the local memorial site.

2. **User-Friendly Design:** The primary objective was to deliver a user-friendly website with an intuitive interface, ensuring a positive experience for visitors exploring both the post and memorial content.

3. **Content Management:** The client required the ability to independently manage and update site content. To achieve this, I implemented a headless CMS using Strapi, empowering them to make real-time updates without technical assistance.

4. **Technological Stack:**
   - **Frontend:** Developed using React for dynamic and responsive user interfaces, complemented by the styling power of Tailwind CSS.
   - **Backend:** Implemented Strapi as a headless CMS, providing a robust content management solution for the client's needs.



## Contributions

- **Web Development:** Spearheaded the end-to-end development of the website, ensuring a seamless merging of content from both the post and memorial sites.
- **Frontend Technologies:** Leveraged React and Tailwind CSS to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.
- **Content Management:** Implemented a headless CMS with Strapi, empowering the client to take control of content updates without relying on external support.

## Outcome

Despite the decision to opt for a different developer due to budget considerations, the project stands as a testament to my skills in web development, user interface design, and strategic content management solutions.

The project repository, hosted on GitHub, includes wireframes, code documentation, and a detailed README to showcase the project's potential and the client's vision for a unified online presence.
